            <p class="text-font">Hello! I'm Meghan Trainor.I'm gone on the physical changes are obvious, but Trainor said there were mental ones, too. After repeat surgeries on her vocal cords, she went into a dark place. Still, "[when Sabara] was like, 'Wanna work out?', I was like, 'No — but OK,'" Trainor said in an interview. She got over that hump and now works out nearly every day. "I'm obsessed with it; I've never felt better." But the pop star's quick to let people know she lost weight "the healthy way," based on a newfound love of exercise, not a desire to be a certain size.</p>
